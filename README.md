## Touch Type App
Goal
Create a program that allows me to locally generate a random string that is displayed


Provide a space for me to type out the generated string


A timer will start and end upon a specific key stroke when string is generated


Then a print out of: comparison of string vs typed string, how long did it take, exptrapolate average words/minute

Bonus: adjust difficulty of string to be typed
Bonus: store averages to be analyzed later
